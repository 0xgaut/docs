  <Card title="Custodian" icon="building-columns">
    Qualified custodians hold the underlying assets that back uAssets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Merchants" icon="store">
    Permissioned actors who facilitate minting and redemption of uAssets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Contracts" icon="file-contract">
    ERC-20 compliant contracts deployed across multiple chains
  </Card>
  <Card title="Users" icon="users">
    Anyone can hold and use uAssets for trading, DeFi, and more
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Custody**: Underlying assets are held by qualified custodians
2. **Minting**: Merchants mint uAssets when collateral is verified
3. **Trading**: uAssets can be traded and used across any supported chain
4. **Redemption**: uAssets can be redeemed for underlying assets at any time
