# Introduction to uAssets

uAssets are 1:1 backed wrapped tokens that bring crypto assets to any blockchain.

## What are uAssets?

uAssets are the wrapped tokens in the Universal Protocol. They represent native assets (like BTC, SOL, DOGE) on different blockchains while maintaining 1:1 value parity with the underlying asset.

## How uAssets Work

Universal enables non-EVM assets (like DOGE, XRP) to be wrapped and traded on any supported chain. This expands the DeFi ecosystem by making previously unavailable assets accessible in onchain markets.

### Minting

uAssets can be minted instantly on any chain once collateral is verified. Merchants, who are permissioned actors, facilitate minting and redemption.

### Redemption

uAssets can be redeemed for their underlying native assets at any time through authorized merchants.

## Use Cases

uAssets unlock new possibilities for DeFi:

- **Trading**: Swap uAssets on decentralized exchanges
- **Lending**: Use uAssets as collateral in lending protocols
- **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity to earn trading fees
- **Cross-Chain**: Access the same asset across multiple chains
