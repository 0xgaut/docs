# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about Universal Protocol and uAssets.

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Universal Protocol?">
    Universal is a wrapped asset protocol designed to enable trading for any token, on any chain. It brings assets like BTC, SOL, DOGE, and XRP to multiple blockchains while maintaining 1:1 backing through qualified custodians.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are uAssets?">
    uAssets are 1:1 backed wrapped tokens that represent native assets on different blockchains. For example, uSOL represents Solana (SOL) and can be used on Ethereum, Polygon, and other chains.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is Universal different from bridges?">
    Unlike bridges that carry smart contract risk, uAssets are backed by real assets held in qualified custody. This eliminates bridge exploit risks while still enabling cross-chain functionality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Who holds the underlying assets?">
    All underlying assets are held by qualified custodians with institutional-grade security, ensuring 1:1 backing for all uAssets.
