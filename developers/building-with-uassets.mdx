# Building with uAssets

Learn how to integrate uAssets into your decentralized application.

## Overview

uAssets are standard ERC-20 tokens that can be integrated into any application that supports token standards. This enables you to:

- Support trading for 80+ assets across multiple chains
- Eliminate bridging complexity for your users
- Access deep liquidity for previously unavailable assets
- Build cross-chain applications without bridge risk

## Integration Options

### Smart Contract Integration

uAssets implement the standard ERC-20 interface, making them compatible with any DeFi protocol:

```solidity
interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

### API Integration

Use the Universal API to enable minting, redemption, and other operations in your application. See the [API Integration](/developers/api-integration) guide for details.
