# Contract Addresses

Find the smart contract addresses for all uAssets across supported blockchains.

## Overview

uAssets are deployed as standard ERC-20 contracts across multiple chains. Use these addresses to interact with uAssets in your smart contracts and applications.

<Warning>
  Always verify contract addresses through official Universal channels before integrating. Scammers may post fake addresses.
</Warning>

## Supported Chains

uAssets are available on multiple blockchains, including:

- Ethereum
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- And more

Visit the official documentation for the complete list of supported chains and their respective contract addresses.

## Integration

Once you have the contract addresses, you can integrate uAssets using the standard ERC-20 interface:

```solidity
interface IERC20 {
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

## Verification

All Universal smart contracts are:

- Open source and verified on block explorers
- Audited by leading security firms
- Deployed through official Universal channels
